# Environment Guide

Use a single environment to avoid cross-shell issues.

## Option A: WSL (Recommended)

- Install Python inside WSL
- Run everything from the WSL shell

## Option B: Windows

- Install Windows Python
- Run everything from PowerShell or CMD

## Notes

- Avoid mixing WSL and Windows Python in the same workflow
- Always read `.env` and content files as UTF-8
