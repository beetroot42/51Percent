Architecture Analysis Task: Local Chain Migration for DAO Jury Mechanism

## Context
Current state: Game uses Sepolia testnet for 5-juror voting, but this undermines the DAO concept since 5 people have no governance power on a public chain.

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Local Chain Architecture Options
- Evaluate: Foundry Anvil vs Hardhat local network
- Criteria: PowerShell compatibility, persistence options, multi-process accessibility
- Consider: Development workflow, testing integration, deployment scripts

### 2. DAO Governance Model
- Design isolated chain environment where 5 jurors ARE the only governance participants
- Evaluate: Single-game ephemeral chain vs persistent local chain
- Consider: Game session lifecycle, replay ability, historical records

### 3. Technical Constraints
- Python backend integration (web3.py)
- 5 private keys management
- Frontend RPC connectivity (MetaMask/local provider)
- Contract deployment automation

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
- Migration steps from Sepolia to local chain
- Configuration changes required
- Testing strategy adjustments
- Deployment process changes
